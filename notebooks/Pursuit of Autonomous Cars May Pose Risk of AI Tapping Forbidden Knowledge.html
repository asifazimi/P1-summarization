      >By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider     Are there things that we must
      not know?</mark
    >This is an age-old question.<mark
      >Some assert that there is the potential for knowledge that ought to not
      be known.</mark
    ><mark
      >In other words, there are ideas, concepts, or mental formulations that
      should we become aware of that knowledge it could be our downfall.</mark
    ><mark
      >The discovery or invention of some new innovation or way of thinking
      could be unduly dangerous.</mark
    ><mark
      >It would be best to not go there, as it were, and avoid ever landing on
      such knowledge: forbidden knowledge.</mark
    ><mark
      >The typical basis for wanting to forbid the discovery or emergence of
      forbidden knowledge is that the adverse consequences are
      overwhelming.</mark
    ><mark
      >The end result is so devastating and undercutting that the bad side
      outweighs the good that could be derived from the knowledge.</mark
    ><mark
      >It is conceivable that there might be knowledge that is so bad that it
      has no good possibilities at all.</mark
    ><mark
      >Thus, rather than trying to balance or weigh the good versus the bad, the
      knowledge has no counterbalancing effects.</mark
    >It is just plain bad.<mark
      >We are usually faced with the matter of knowledge that has both the good
      and the bad as to how it might be utilized or employed.</mark
    >This then leads to a dogged debate about whether the bad is so bad that it
    outweighs the good.<mark
      >On top of this, there is the unrealized bad and the unrealized good,
      which could be differentiated from the realized bad and the realized good
      (in essence, the knowledge might be said to be either good or bad, though
      this is purely conceptual and not put into real-world conditions to attest
      or become realized as such).</mark
    ><mark
      >The most familiar reference to forbidden knowledge is likely evoked via
      the Garden of Eden and the essence of forbidden fruit.</mark
    >A contemporary down-to-earth example often discussed about forbidden
    knowledge consists of the atomic bomb.<mark
      >Some suggest that the knowledge devised or invented to ultimately produce
      a nuclear bomb provides a quite visible and overt exemplar of the problems
      associated with knowledge.</mark
    ><mark
      >Had the knowledge about being able to attain an atomic bomb never been
      achieved, there presumably would not be any such device.</mark
    ><mark
      >In debates about the topic, it is feasible to take a resolute position
      favoring the attainment of an atomic bomb and there are equally
      counterbalancing contentions sternly disfavoring this attainment.</mark
    ><mark
      >One perplexing problem about forbidden knowledge encompasses knowing
      beforehand the kind of knowledge that might end up in the forbidden
      category.</mark
    >This is a bit of a Catch-22 or circular type of puzzle.<mark
      >You might discover knowledge and then ascertain it ought to be forbidden,
      but the cat is kind of out of the bag due to the knowledge having been
      already uncovered or rendered.</mark
    >Oopsie, you should have in advance decided to not go there and therefore
    have avoided falling into the forbidden knowledge zone.On a related twist,
    suppose that we could beforehand declare what type of knowledge is to be
    averted because it is predetermined as forbidden.Some people might
    accidentally discover the knowledge, doing so by happenstance, and now
    they’ve again potentially opened Pandora’s box.Meanwhile, there might be
    others that, regardless of being instructed to not derive any such stated
    forbidden knowledge, do so anyway.<mark
      >This then takes us to a frequently used retort about forbidden knowledge,
      namely, if you don’t seek the forbidden knowledge there is a chance that
      someone else will, and you’ll be left in the dust because they got there
      first.</mark
    >In that preemptive viewpoint, the claim is that it is better to go ahead
    and forage for the forbidden knowledge and not get caught behind the
    eight-ball when someone else beats you to the punch.Round and round we can
    go.The main thing that most would agree to is that knowledge is power.The
    alluded to power could be devastating and destroy others, possibly even
    leading to the self-destruction of the wielder of the knowledge.<mark
      >Yet there is also the potential for knowledge to be advantageous and save
      humanity from other ills.</mark
    ><mark>Maybe we ought to say that knowledge is powerful.</mark
    ><mark
      >Despite that perhaps obvious proclamation, we might also add that
      knowledge can decay and gradually become outdated or less potent.</mark
    >Furthermore, since we are immersing ourselves herein into the cauldron of
    the love-it or hate-it knowledge conundrum, knowledge can be known and yet
    undervalued, perhaps only becoming valuable at a later time and in a
    different light.There is a case to be made that humankind has a seemingly
    irresistible allure toward more and more knowledge.Some philosophers suggest
    you are unlikely to be able to bottle up or stop this quest for knowledge.If
    that’s the manner of how humanity will be, this implies that you must find
    ways to control or contain knowledge and give up on the belief that we can
    altogether avoid landing into forbidden knowledge.There is a relatively new
    venue prompting a lot of anxious hand wringing pertaining to forbidden
    knowledge, namely the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI).Here’s the
    rub.<mark
      >Suppose that we are able to craft AI systems that make use of knowledge
      about how humans can think.</mark
    >There are two major potential gotchas.<mark
      >First, the AI systems themselves might end up doing good things, and they
      also might end up doing bad things.</mark
    ><mark
      >If the bad outweighs the good, maybe we are shooting our own foot by
      allowing AI to be put into use.</mark
    ><mark
      >Secondly, perhaps this could be averted entirely by deciding that there
      is forbidden knowledge about how humans think, and we ought to not
      discover or reveal those mental mechanisms.</mark
    >It is the classic stepwise logic that step A axiomatically leads to step
    B.<mark
      >We won’t need to worry about AI systems (step B), if we never allow the
      achievement of step A (figuring out how humans think and then imparting
      that into computers), since the attainment of AI would presumably not
      arise.</mark
    >In any case, there is inarguably a growing concern about AI.Plenty of
    efforts are underway to promulgate a semblance of AI Ethics, meaning that
    those developers and indeed all stakeholders that are conceiving of,
    building, and putting into use an AI system needs to consider the ethical
    aspects of their efforts.AI systems have been unveiled and placed into use
    replete with all sorts of notable concerns, including incorporating unsavory
    biases and other problems.All told, one bold and somewhat stark argument is
    that the pursuit of AI is being underpinned or stoked by the discovery and
    then exploitation of forbidden knowledge.Be aware that many would scoff at
    this allegation.There are those deeply immersed in the field of AI who would
    laugh that there is anything in the entirety of AI to date that constitutes
    potential forbidden knowledge.The technology and technological elements are
    relatively ho-hum, they would argue.You would be hard-pressed to pinpoint
    what AI-related knowledge that is already known comes anywhere near the
    ballpark of forbidden knowledge.<mark
      >For those that concur with that posture, there is the reply that it might
      be future knowledge that we have not yet attained that is the upcoming
      forbidden kind, and for which we are heading pell-mell down that
      path.</mark
    >Thus, they would concede that we haven’t arrived at forbidden knowledge at
    this juncture, but this is an insidious distractor due to the aspect that it
    masks or belies our qualms entailing the possibility that it lays in wait at
    the next turn.One area where AI is being actively used is to create
    Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).We are gradually seeing the emergence of
    self-driving cars and can expect self-driving trucks, self-driving
    motorcycles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, self-driving ships,
    self-driving submersibles, etc.<mark
      >Today’s conventional cars are eventually going to give way to the advent
      of AI-based, true self-driving cars.</mark
    ><mark>Self-driving cars are driven via an AI driving system.</mark>There
    isn’t a need for a human driver at the wheel, and nor is there a provision
    for a human to drive the vehicle.<mark
      >Here’s an intriguing question that has arisen: Might the crafting of
      AI-based true self-driving cars take us into the realm of discovering
      forbidden knowledge, and if so, what should be done about this?</mark
    >Before jumping into the details, I’d like to clarify what is meant when
    referring to true self-driving cars.<mark
      >For my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link
      here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/   
      Why this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation
      here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/   
      For more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion
      here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/   
      For the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation
      here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/   
      Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars    As a clarification, true
      self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own
      and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.</mark
    ><mark
      >These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car
      that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually
      considered at Level 2 or Level 3.</mark
    >The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being
    semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that
    are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).<mark
      >There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet
      even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will
      take to get there.</mark
    ><mark
      >Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction
      by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though
      there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se
      (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our
      highways and byways, some contend).</mark
    ><mark
      >Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those
      types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional
      vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic
      (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally
      applicable).</mark
    ><mark
      >For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be
      forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely
      that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves
      falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to
      avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their
      attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.</mark
    >You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle,
    regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level
    3.<mark
      >For why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally
      eschewed, see my explanation
      here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/   
      To be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips

      The ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my
      indication
      here: http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/   
      Be aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to
      self-driving cars, here’s my call to
      arms: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/   
      Self-Driving Cars And Forbidden Knowledge    For Level 4 and Level 5 true
      self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the
      driving task.</mark
    >All occupants will be passengers.<mark>The AI is doing the driving.</mark
    >One aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in
    today’s AI driving systems is not sentient.In other words, the AI is
    altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and
    most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.Why
    this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?Because I want to
    underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not
    ascribing human qualities to the AI.Please be aware that there is an ongoing
    and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI.In essence, people
    are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and
    inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.With that clarification, you
    can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about
    the facets of driving.Driving and all that it entails will need to be
    programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving
    car.<mark
      >Let’s dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this
      topic.</mark
    >The crux here is whether there is forbidden knowledge lurking within the
    existing and ongoing efforts to achieve AI-based true self-driving
    cars.<mark
      >We’ll begin by considering the status of the existent efforts and then
      shift into speculation about the future of such efforts.</mark
    ><mark
      >Per the earlier discussion about whether there is forbidden knowledge
      that has already perchance been revealed or discovered via the efforts
      toward today’s AI systems all told, the odds seem stacked against such a
      notion at this time, and likewise the same could be said about the pursuit
      of self-driving cars.</mark
    ><mark
      >Essentially, there doesn’t seem to be any forbidden knowledge per se that
      has been discovered or revealed during the self-driving cars development
      journey so far, at least with respect to the conventional wisdom about
      what forbidden knowledge might entail.</mark
    >One could try to argue that it is premature to reach such a conclusion and
    that we might, later on, realize that forbidden knowledge was indeed
    uncovered or invented, and we just didn’t realize it.That is a rabbit hole
    that we’ll not go down for now, though you are welcome to keep that
    presumption at hand if so desired.<mark
      >That covers the present, and ergo we can turn our attention to the
      future.</mark
    ><mark
      >Generally, the efforts underway today have been primarily aimed at
      achieving Level 4, and the hope is that someday we will go beyond Level 4
      and attain Level 5.</mark
    >To get to a robust Level 4, most would likely say that we can continue the
    existing approaches.Not everyone would agree with that assumption.<mark
      >Some believe that we will get stymied within Level 4.</mark
    >Furthermore, the inability to produce a robust Level 4 will ostensibly
    preclude us from being able to attain Level 5.<mark
      >There is a contingent that suggests we need to start over and set aside
      the existing AI approaches, which otherwise are taking us down a dead-end
      or blind alley.</mark
    >An entirely new way of devising AI for autonomous vehicles is needed, they
    would vehemently argue.<mark
      >There is also a contingent that asserts the Level 4 itself is a type of
      dead-end.</mark
    ><mark
      >In brief, those proponents would say that we will achieve a robust Level
      4, though this will do little good towards attaining Level 5.</mark
    >Once again, their view is similar to the preceding remark that we will need
    to come up with some radically new understandings about AI and the nature of
    cognitive acumen in order to get self-driving cars into the Level 5
    realm.<mark
      >Aha, it is within that scope of having to dramatically revisit and revamp
      what AI is and how we can advance significantly in the pursuit of AI that
      the forbidden knowledge question can reside.</mark
    >In theory, perhaps the only means of attaining Level 5 will be to strike
    upon some knowledge that we do not yet know and that for which bodes for
    falling within the realm of forbidden knowledge.To some, this
    seems farfetched.They would emphatically ask; just what kind of knowledge
    are you even talking about?<mark>Here’s their logic.</mark
    ><mark>Humans are able to drive cars.</mark
    ><mark
      >Humans do not seem to need or possess forbidden knowledge as it relates
      to the act of driving a car.</mark
    >Therefore, it seems ridiculous on the face of things to claim or contend
    that the only means to get AI-based true self-driving cars, for which they
    would be driven on an equal basis as human drivers can drive, would require
    the discovery or invention of whatever might be construed as forbidden
    knowledge.Seems like pretty ironclad logic.<mark
      >The retort is that humans have common-sense reasoning.</mark
    ><mark
      >With common-sense reasoning, we seem to know all sorts of things about
      the world around us.</mark
    >When we drive a car, we intrinsically make use of our common-sense
    reasoning.<mark
      >We take for granted that we do have a common-sense reasoning capacity,
      and similarly, we take for granted that it integrally comes to the fore
      when driving a car.</mark
    ><mark
      >Attempts to create AI that can exhibit the equivalent of human
      common-sense reasoning have made ostensibly modest or some would say
      minimal progress (to clarify, those pursuing this line of inquiry are to
      be lauded, it’s just that no earth-shattering breakthroughs seem to have
      been reached and none seem on the immediate horizon).</mark
    >Yes, there are some quite fascinating and exciting efforts underway, but
    when you measure those against the everyday common-sense reasoning of
    humans, there is no comparison.They are night and day.<mark
      >If this were a contest, the humans win hands down, no doubt about it, and
      the AI experimental efforts encompassing common-sense reasoning are mere
      playthings in contrast.</mark
    ><mark>You might have gleaned where this line of thought is headed.</mark
    ><mark
      >The belief by some is that until we crack open the enigma of common-sense
      reasoning, there is little chance of achieving a Level 5, and perhaps also
      this will hold back the Level 4 too.</mark
    >It could be that a secret ingredient of sorts for autonomous vehicles is
    the need to figure out and include common-sense reasoning into AI-based
    driving and piloting systems.<mark
      >If you buy into that logic, the added assertion is that maybe within the
      confines of how common-sense reasoning takes place is a semblance of
      forbidden knowledge.</mark
    ><mark
      >On the surface, you would certainly assume that if we knew entirely how
      common-sense reasoning works, there would not appear to be any cause for
      alarm or concern.</mark
    ><mark
      >The act of employing common-sense reasoning does not seem to necessarily
      embody forbidden knowledge.</mark
    ><mark
      >The twist is that perhaps the underlying cognitive means that gives rise
      to the advent of common-sense reasoning is where there is forbidden
      knowledge.</mark
    >Some deep-rooted elements in the nature of human thought and how we form
    common sense and undertake common-sense reasoning are possibly a type of
    knowledge that will be shown as crucial and a forbidden knowledge
    formulation.For more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link

    On the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details
    elicitation: https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/ 
    I’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car

    scoop: https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/

    self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details

    Conclusion    Wow, that’s quite a bit of pondering, contemplation, and (some
    would say) wild thinking.<mark
      >Maybe so, but it is a consideration that some would wish that we gave at
      least some credence toward and devoted attention to.</mark
    ><mark
      >There is the angst that we might find ourselves by happenstance stumbling
      into forbidden knowledge on these voracious self-driving cars
      quests.</mark
    ><mark
      >For however you might emphasize that having AI-based true self-driving
      cars will be a potential blessing, proffering mobility-for-all and leading
      to reducing the number of car crash-related fatalities, there is a
      sneaking suspicion that it will not be all-good.</mark
    ><mark
      >The catch or trap could be that there is some kind of forbidden knowledge
      that will get brought to the eye and we will inevitably kick ourselves
      that we didn’t see it coming.</mark
    >The next time you are munching on a delicious apple, give some thought to
    whether self-driving cars might be forbidden fruit.We are on the path to
    taking a big bite, and we’ll have to see where that takes us.Copyright 2021
